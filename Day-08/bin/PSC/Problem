Problem statement:
Make a class Person which Has-A relationship with the Address class and has following instance variable-
//is-A relatioship - extends anothers
//has-A relationship - one class has object of another class.

	name :String
	gender :String
	
Address class has following instance variable-
	city : String
	state : String
	pinCode : String
	
Create another class Instructor which is a child of Person and has following instance variable-
	instructorId : int
	salary : int

Create another class Student which is a child of Person and has following instance variable-
	studentId : int	
	courseEnrolled : String
	courseFee : int

Create a Main class with a following static method-
	public static Person generatePerson(Person person);

Inside the main method of this Main class call the generatePerson() method with
one object of the student and one object of the instructor class.
And print the same with the help of overriding toString method.

Note : Override toString method in all the classes.

Eg- main():

public static void main(String[] args) {

	Person newStudent = generatePerson(new Student());
	
	Person newTeacher = generatePerson(new Teacher());
	
	System.out.println(newStudent);
	System.out.println(newTeacher)
}

Sample OutPut:
Student [studentId=1, courseFee=300000, courseEnrolled=JA111,
address=Address [city=Chennai, state=TN, pincode=60001]]

Instructor [instructorId =456, salary=45612, address=Address [city=Chennai,
state=TN, pinCode=60001]]
